Hello, today is 13/07/2023.
Today marks the first day that I finish a so-called personal project.
After a successful moderation of a chess tournament between my twitter friends, 
I decided to scale it into a chess league.
And who said a chess league, said players, and who said players, said games.
And who said games, said data to track, display and retrieve.
So I decided to build up all the needed scripts and files to work easily on this leagues.

We will be having 3 leagues with the same 12 persons in out first edition : 
League 1 : bullet type (2+1).
League 2 : blitz type (5+3).
League 3 : rapid type (10+3).

Having 12 players means 22 games in each league to track.
Having 12 players means also 22 rounds to track.
Having 12 players means 6 games per each round from each league to track.

I had fun bulding this whole concept alone.

Here is my twitter account if you even wanna contact me for any project of this kind https://twitter.com/sakuun_aah
